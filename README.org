#+TITLE: Travel Journal app

An app that helps you journal your travels, made for my /CS3040 Mobile Design and Development/ course at university. For the time I had, I am happy with the current implementation details of Travel Journal, which follow best practices and allow for easier simpler development in the future.

I could of hacked together functionality to meet more of the design requirements for my submission, but I don't regret learning best practices for Android development, as well as exploring advanced features—namely the heterogeneous timeline—which would be necessary for a truly unique and fun end-user experience.
